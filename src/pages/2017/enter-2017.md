Watching the events of 2016 and early 2017 unfold has been a very curious experience for me. Shocking but also rejuvenating, though for a slightly different reason than you might expect.

I suffer from some kind of emotional detachment issues when it comes to society and the people around me _as a whole_. It is maddening, really. In short, it's impossible for me to see reason in forming a group for any purpose, be it political, religious, otherwise ideological or even stereotypical. If I squint hard enough I might be starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel, maybe. But first, let us observe the zeitgeist.

## What is politics, anyway?

This strange emotional distance causes me to look down upon everyone who does take a role in some kind of group. I feel that anyone who does have some social group has "animalized" themselves, purposefully succumbed to a state where your own reasoning no longer matters favoring reasoning provided by someone else instead. For a long time I simply thought I was missing something, that my troubles while growing up had prevented me from seeing something others had seen. I tried to find myself by being politically active during my studies, but the more I tried the more *fake* it felt. I started from the easily justifiable political left and trawled to somewhere in the center-right, visiting greens and pirates along the way. 

Ofcourse, in the end, none of it mattered. I was naive. People who are politically inclined towards some group will happily continue being in that group - they are invested in it both financially and socially and there is no use in trying to bring them to a better world which a competing group defines. Some people are "supporters" but most understand the game well enough to treat their group only as a means to and end, leaving emotions behind.  
Others, people who vote but are politically astray, will vote for the one that performs some stunt neat enough to win their vote. Responsibility for delivering promises is kept in the back of the voters' minds as a testament for the futility of wishful thinking.

Thus, I see politics and other societal troubles as a interesting circus, where the parts of the groups who understand the game laugh at the society at the expense of those who don't understand the game. Your choices are to join the game or become victim to it. It's a game where groups mutually keep themselves in a pseudostruggle for power.

This brings us to the recent games of power, not just Brexit and Trump but even in my homeland Finland. Luckily, so far the local players here are smart enough to not let too brash players on the game board, but the whining of the world permeates all. The recent results of the votes were bred from a carefully cultivated sense of nationalism where insignificant issues have been amplified by careful adventures in the political games. Many jimmies have been rustled in an alarmingly short period of time. Not just the obvious nationalist anti-immigrant camp, but everyone taking part in the discussion, fueling it and watching the worlds burn.

## Longing for nothing

So what's the deal? You have this figured out and this sounds great, no? Observing people's antics and patronizingly laughing from above - what could be better? Well, there is still the previous issue: I feel I am missing something that other people have. Thus, I guess I am jealous. I do not feel I am complete until I feel a connection to something. For the life of me I can not figure out what this could be. Humans are pack animals and inherently need a group. The inability for me to find something to socially relate to indirectly causes various psychological problems including, but not limited to, prolonged periods of depression and panic attacks.

The recent political movements are all just embarrassing madness, ofcourse, and I feel even more distanced from the crazy that drives this, but for the first time ever I feel something. I don't know what I feel, though. I might defend my way of life, I might attack my way of life. I don't know. But it's a start.
