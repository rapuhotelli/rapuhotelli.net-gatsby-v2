title: "The meaning of life, obviously"
---

I asked a friend what should I write about next. "Talk about the meaning of life", was the obvious answer. Let's do it, then.

# Definition
>Note: this is in context of a westerner who lives in abundance as the question was asked by such a person. Different philosophical branches have a very different take on what is happiness and what is life.

To start with, life is not a toy you can buy so the question is not _what_ is the meaning of life, but more like how to make life feel meaningful.

The problem of the meaning of life is quite easy to define, but associating yourself with the definition is the hard part. The approach I take is the approach of an utilitarian engineer. Go figure...

First, the whole picture:

1. You are probably a human being, a pack animal.
2. You were born without being asked if you wanted or not.
4. A lot of stuff happens.
5. You will eventually die _probably_ without being asked when would you like to die.

Life is forced onto you and at the end you will die. I keep reading lame quotes where someone on their deathbed laments that the one thing they regret is something-or-other, typically not taking some opportunities or not seeing the world or whatever. I think having any regrets like this, or forcibly doing things in fear of having similar deathbed regrets is completely against the purpose of life.

Simply put, the meaning of life is to live your life and enjoy the ride. Cheesy, yeah, but the hard part is to make people realize how should they enjoy it, or to be precise, what should they be satisfied in so that they can take pleasure in that satisfaction. The challenge depends on the individual in question, but typically you can just ask: 

1. Are you satisfied with your daily life?
2. If you are not, why? What can you do about it? Why not?

Again, cheese, but let's take a closer look.

# Demand 

The average western person often sees their life as an empty shell. This is even more true today than ever before, now when internet dominates our social lives and social media completely saturates what we perceive of others and the society around us. I like to think that we have a *Demand*, which is a constant. When you are a child you have a demand for simple things, but you feel very strongly about it. As you grow up, you still have demand but you learn to manage it. At some point you reach the point where your demand has only value in relation to the people around you. You have a job, hobbies, a spouse, friends, stuff. Still you demand but now what to demand is presented to you by your surroundings. Buy a car, gain status. Buy a house, gain status. Are you limited by money or other societal factors? You can always present yourself to others in such a way that you appear being something that the society would expect of you. Fear the stigma!

The Demand makes you feel incomplete for the entirety of your life. Everywhere you look you see only things you desire - you learn to ignore the rest. I want to be that person! _He_ doesn't appreciate what he has as much as I would, give it to me! I _demand_ a raise, I am worth more than this! For the majority of your life you are in a Demand state where the next step seems unreachable and you start asking these questions. What do I do with my life? How did I get into this mess? _What is the meaning of life?_ A person without Demand could be considered depressed and is "cured" once they able to reach for the next step again, demand just a little bit.

What if something changes in your life and you fall down? It's a shock. Something you depended on is no more and you are almost paralyzed and you cling on to the things you have, maybe reaching for support. Eventually you find a foothold in something and you feel stable again, but it's far from where you left off. Still, you are satisfied, relieved. The world you came from seems distant.

The fall is often attributed to spiritual awakenings and other phenomena in which the person in question declares they now find meaning in their life - post-traumatically. I believe this is what everyone should look forward to. A similar effect drives all religions, politics and other movements. Recently only populism has started to move the average masses whose Demand is not movable by their own merit. Other movements just do not have the personal connection required to shake the Demand at its core.

If you are an average western person who has it all but lack meaning of life, you have several options:

1. Make a radical change in your life to force the Demand out of hiding. This could be anything. Move abroad. Sell everything you have. Someone feels the safety of the home is choking their Demand and choose a divorce. You decide.
2. Learn not to Demand. Visualize the path that took you all the way up to this point and fucking be happy about it.
3. Accept the existence of Demand and embrace it, just understand that it exists and don't let it dominate your life.
4. (Bonus!) Make the society enforce the Demand upon you. Go to war. Do some crimes and go to jail. Vote for chaos in your next election, etc. Arrange the society so that your primal desires become justified instead of irresponsible. (Not recommended, but seems to be popular these days).

Finally, getting back to regrets: I don't think you should regret anything. Remember that you will die. You will just die. Dying of old age is not a better or "less regretful" death than dying sooner. The only way dying of old age is better is that there's a higher chance of not having your friends around mourning for you anymore, but even then you're no longer there to care. Being old, lonely and miserable sucks ass and everyone should avoid it. Ask any geriatrician. 

Just live your life and Demand things that you know are reachable in order to have a steady supply of meaningful satisfaction to you and to you only [1]. Not to be confused with selfishness. "You cannot love others until you learn to love yourself" is a classic cheese but very valid.

----
[1] I'll probably come back later to how you would manipulate the Demand to your own benefit.

PS.
For the entirety of my life I've wished upon a force majeure that would bless me with choice #1 but that is really hard to arrange yourself. I'm somewhere between #2 and #3 as I feel I got started on an average life about 10 years after people normally do but that, again, is a story for another time.
