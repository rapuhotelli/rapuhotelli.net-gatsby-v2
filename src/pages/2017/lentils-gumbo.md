title: "Epic Lentils Gumbo"
---

To kickstart my fabulous new blog I shall introduce you to one of the greatest and easiest recipes I know of. It was taught to me by an amazing ex-colleague.

The final product will be a "soup" which is thick enough to be eaten with a fork. It's vegan unless you choose otherwise (sometimes I add cream cheese for taste)

## Ingredients
You will need:

* 1-2 red onions (or plain)
* 5-10 cloves of garlic (the more the better)
* 2-3 carrots
* 3-4 potatoes
* (other vegetables, like zuccini, cauliflower, broccoli, rutabaga, sweet potato, mushrooms etc. 
* 500g - 1000g mashed tomatoes
* 1-2 dl dry red lentils 
* a splash of oil
* [a stock/broth cube/base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouillon_cube) or equivalent seasoning
* Spices: curry (lots), paprika (lots), chili, basil and others that float your boat (ginger, peppers ...?)

## Do this

1. Heat the oil in a large pot
+ Slice the onions and garlic and toss them in the oil
+ Add all spices in the oilgarlic
+ Mix them for a while and let the onions soak it all
+ After you're satisfied, add the more "solid" vegetables (potatoes, carrots) first and stir them a bit, then add the rest of the vegetables
+ Add half a litre of water
+ Add the stock cube, cleansed & soaked lentils and any other vegetables that you might still have remaining. Add the tomato mash.
+ Simmer on low heat for 30-60 minutes. Feel free to take your time (hours, even) - it just gets better, trust me. Stir once in a while to prevent anything from burning.
+ If you have any fresh herbs for taste, add them last.

Once you take it off the stove and let it soak in, it will settle to a more solid form, if it's not already.
