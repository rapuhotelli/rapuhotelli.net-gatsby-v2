I expected much of the year 2018, though I had little idea what to expect. I did not get quite _the_ fulfilment from work which I was hoping for, but it's still not something to complain about. Taking a career shift from in-house development to consultant life was mostly a leap of faith above anything else. Looking back exactly one year there are some things I miss and a lot of things I don't.
 
I greatly miss having English as the de-facto language for work. Finnish is such a janky language with half of the vocabulary missing in almost any modern context, while I appreciate my (quite entertaining) co-workers being able to express themselves in a way that makes them so entertaining. Dramatic weekly meetings about internal business details would not reach desirable results if stakeholders were unable to communicate themselves in a native way. Thankfully I have a colleague or two and ofcourse, you, dear anonymous reader.

One missed expectation I blame myself for was a slight naivety regarding the quality of work and stress management. While consultants are more free to change projects if they feel the clouds above their heads begin to darken, it doesn't directly translate to living on the bleeding edge. I was expecting the day-to-day coding work to be more satisfying, but of course your client dictates the boundaries of your sanity and you must find your satisfaction by other means. My pride prevents me from denying "low quality work" just for the sake of what I would _like_ to do and I seem to have developed a noticeable distaste for people who are more direct about their professional desires. Being able to swallow my pride is still on my to-do list. Maybe next year â€“ human relations permitting.

On a more positive note, I am much more in-tune with myself today than I was a year ago. I can't put a single finger on it to explain why, but I believe my employer's trust in me to carry a responsibility silently heals me over time. A month ago I bought my own (huge) flat, which will eventually enable me to do all my hobbies and host whatever dinner parties without having to wade through puddles of self-pity. An opportunity arose which I immediately took and I haven't regretted it for a minute. This is a move I would have never believed I would do, as ordinary as it is.

It seems like my life works in cycles of one year, with a lot of stuff happening at the turn of the year and almost nothing in between. Last year was new professional opportunities and this year is a new home and better quality of life out-of-office. I'm running out of things to dream of, but for now I dream of being the dungeon master of my very own D&D campaign. The part of town I live in these days can be loosely contextually translated as the "Iron Hill", which reminded me of an old Blind Guardian track from their Silmarillion-themed album. Maybe my totally awesome and not-yet-existing D&D campaign will be set in an industrial village with a bunch of political shenanigans further escalated by a mysterious seasonal curse, causing time to stand still. 

So this must be that _inspiration_ thing people so often speak of.
