For a media tech nerd like me, one of the greatest geek-outs is the World Cup currently on-going in Russia. The camera work and all the real-time stuff they produce is mind-blowing. This year, during the tournament they have been showing a bunch of nostalgic inserts from ye olden days and a colleague was ranting about how horrible the old visuals or computer-genearated graphics looked.

I'm a great fan of the real time parts such as timer displays and scoreboards and such. They are a fascinating mirror to the spirit and visual style of the time period of the recording. For example, in the 2000s everything had to be round or elliptical and any square shapes _must_ have rounded corners. Meanwhile I was trying to force rounded corners on websites using table-layouts which was nasty business, but once you got it working (and background images properly sliced), holy fuck was it cool. It was done becase _you could_, not because it made any visual sense. Then again, that was the reasoning for many things back then.

## Try it yourself

The style of the 2002 World Cup was cool as hell and nothing could possibly be more awesome. Of course, it was only a year or two later when it felt outdated already. Here's an excercise for you. Below is a capture of a scoreboard from some time ago. Could you guess when was this game played?

Several hints are deductible:

1.  It's primitive and feels like a physical board being filmed, which it might well be for all I know.
2.  The large I in the corner is the period indicator. It's a bit hidden behind the scores trying to be _cool_ but not yet cool enough to have rounded corners.
3.  The image itself is somewhat vibrant and clearer than what you would have in the 80s.

90s it is then! Or to be precise, the 1998 World Cup in Brazil. That's easy. So here's a challenge for you: try to guess what would the _next_ graphical style or visual movement look like? How would you know?

## The Design Singularity

As it happens, people living _in_ an era don't know the distinctive features of their time, but I can take an entirely uneducated recreational guess! In my opinion, the main _variable_ of today is the wilful submission to algorithmically curated social media and the endless feed of visual irritant. That's a mouthful... but do design trends care? There is so much stuff online! So much that in fact production speed is more important than quality and in many cases the art we consume has degraded and people are fine with that, because _what matters is the material you are exposed to the most._

A professional carefully creates a video for people to enjoy. The video is great and makes people happy for a couple of minutes. Then I record something from a phone and use a cheap app to insert static text on top of the video to provide exposition. The end result horrifying, but making it took a hundredth of the time spent making the professional, and what's better - it took no skill to make. I have become the catalyst of gilded shit and a true child of our time. Lately, academia has become concerned that entire generations might lose their identities and memories when web services of their childhoods eventually shut down, but I digress – _that_ is a story for another time.

We're living in a time where everyone is an expert and the minds of the masses are merely a transit for the information used to create even more addictive irritant in one digital form or another. **Visual trends have become a non-concern** as design solutions no longer have boundaries which previously were imposed by techincal limitations.

What I'm saying is this: I don't think we can recognize stilistic era-specific nuances in a purely graphical sense anymore. There is no distinguishable trend among the flood of visual junk we feed ourselves. The winds changing the digital footprint are not driven by any coherent force we can identify today, but I _do_ believe there are other factors which would give it away. This is what I call the UI or **design singularity**: when you no longer know. Data from last week is instantly replaced by data from this week. Objects always stay the same age and only you become older.

## Futurism!

For our second excercise, let's have a look at the timer below. This one is from the 2018 World Cup. Just from looking at it and comparing it to our previous excercise, what do we know?

I asked some friends what they thought of this and one thing came up – image quality still has some way to go. Not that anyone strongly asks for it, but it will be improving because it can be improved. I agree and I argue that the 2018 timer agrees as well. Using the same bullets from 1998:

1.  It's a purely digital rendition mixed onto a live feed. This is probably not going to change until someone invents a new way to watch TV without TVs which is as convenient as watching TV (VR... at least you tried).
2.  It's trying to be cool by using an esoteric font which turned out to be a bit hazy on screen. The letter K resembles R a bit too much to my liking. The typeface used in player jerseys is even worse and looks like a cyrillic mockery, totally unreadable from a distance.
3.  The tiny divider sign between the scores goes almost unnoticed and the details in the national flags are lost. In 1998 flags weren't even an option: the resolution wasn't anywhere near acceptable.

The resolution is not large enough. Well, I captured that image on my laptop and not on an ultra duper high resolution TV, but laptops and mobile devices are a perfectly valid way to watch TV today. I like to think that the weird fonts used in the tournament's official material are a reflection of our memeing times – if it looks funky at a glance, it's fine! This is why I don't think we're at the singularity yet: advantages of very high resolutions have not been thoroughly explored.

Thus my uneducated recreational guess is that once display resolution steadily increases, we're entering a phase where design trends utilize that resolution as much as they can in new ways. Not because it makes sense, but because we can (as has been the habit before) – hopefully indirectly influencing the quality of the junk we're fed through the web. However once we reach the singularity, resolution is the last milestone we have until it can no longer be increased. After it no longer makes sense to increase resolution... I don't know. What do _you_ think?
