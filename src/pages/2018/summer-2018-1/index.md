I don't have any photos of anyone in my home as family was never very significant, but I _have_ been blessed with delightful friends and colleagues who make life worthwhile. I am that obnoxious dude at the other end of the table taking those awkward photos, making people cringe in unison. Something to remember these special moments by.

In the likely event of you not knowing what _rölö_ is, let [this horse](//i.imgur.com/VllER.png) explain. I guess we could translate rölö as "shit's going to escalate soon."

I haven't posted anything in the _kitchen_ series in a while. Maybe I'll think of something for my next post. Summer is not over and the forecast tells me the finite resource known as sunshine is not depleting quite yet – maybe I'll have enough material for a part two. Anyway, thank you for reading!
