> Notice/update: this post was written under extreme mental stress and is not to be taken seriously. I'm leaving it as a reminder for how easily things can get sour if you don't take care of yourself.

Workplace switch, 2 months later. It went pretty much exactly as I expected (or feared) it would. I enjoy the company of my colleagues and I feel good whenever I'm able to deliver a meaningful contribution. I spend a considerable amount of time at the office because I have nothing else on my mind. However, what I [previously feared](/2018/enter-2018/) came to pass. What I thought was the top of the world was in actuality just a world for people whose minds have remained unshattered. Part of me wishes I had remained behind in my old daily routine where I was safe, and part of me wants to see opportunities in this – opportunities for a distant salvation. But the truth is I am tired. I have grown weary of the constant struggle between me and the world I perceive as unfair, even when I know everything is more or less fine. It's all about the [demand](/2017/meaning-of-life), and I my ability to resist is fading. 

Again I scared myself the past weekend when a person said something I wish they hadn't said. I was reminded of the gleeful innocence many people are able to live in, delivered like a slap in the face. "I didn't know people could _actually_ just be lonely", was said. I wish I never had to learn either. Imagine being so privileged that you can choose not to ever be socially responsible for your behavior. Imagine being so privileged that you can ignore people around you if they do not entertain you. Imagine being so privileged that you can not actually know what loneliness is. 

## My madness 

Surprise! It was high time for my annual anxiety attack. I felt a familiar, bitter rage boil inside me that could only be described as madness. I see thought-clouding red everywhere, but it's not anger, exactly. My madness is disbelief mixed with bitter amusement. Imagine a Disney villain laughing maniacally. It's an utter, surreal disappointment in the world. Of course, I bear no ill will toward any of the human beings I encounter. Rather, I see people as vessels sent to **laugh at me** at my expense like schoolyard bullies – except the bullies are everyone in the world. _Never forget that_ **you** _have failed. You do not belong among us_, they scream, blaming for something I cannot grasp.

Thus, my madness is a coping mechanism of a kind. For the majority of my childhood I had to believe everyone were evil and hunted me, transforming me into a silent, scared recluse and giving me my only sense of safety. It never quite went away, I guess. Little triggers related to injustice and intentional harm brings it out and the best way to fight against it is to minimize risks when dealing with people I don't know so well. Unsurprisingly, this is the reason I left politics and volunteer work. I don't need to be convinced if (or when) the world is going to burn. I already know.

And just like that... it was over. I'm proud of myself that this time it didn't last that long. Typically I suppress emotions gone wild by eating so much I pass out, to prevent further harm, but this time my madness lasted only an hour or two. I took this opportunity to contemplate and decided I should probably come up with some kind of goals for life. I believe this "depression" of mine is curable if I ever became satisfied with myself, that is, not carrying the blaming weight of the world on my shoulders. So, having something to _go for_ might help with that.

## New purposes

I've arranged my life in such way that I may enjoy a "groundhog day" for as long as I'm able to maintain it. This is why a change of employer is such a big deal for me. In a groundhog day, I am safe. It's predictable. Breaking it would expose me to the world, which is probably what I need the most, really... Being vulnerable without fear. I identify the following things as my key obstacles and changing them somehow would help the most, but I'm having a hard time affecting them in my current groundhog state. 

#### Professional identity
Professionally I should pick a focus. I hail from the early days of the internet where specializations didn't exist, and today not specializing is a slow, stressful suicide. However, my new employer (which I love to death) encourages generalization, further adding to my stress. 

#### Home function 
Right now my home is worthless. It's just a place where I sleep and spend some time so that the next workday came around sooner. I try to do "hobbies" at home, like music and cooking and whatever, but it's shallow. I don't get true satisfaction from my time at home. Is that normal? How would I improve this?

#### Love somebody
This is something I try not to think of. This is the greatest exposure of your weaknesses and I'm probably never going to be able to risk it again. Then again, it offers the greatest risk-reward ratio regarding sanity, but the rational nerd in me tosses this aside as a completely irrelevant task – there simply isn't _enough_ to be gained. The _non_-rational human being is also suspicious: as time passes I find it increasingly harder to express any kind of realistic infatuation. I don't have the energy to go after a partner, and as a quote on one of our office's whiteboards elegantly put it:

> Love is like a fart. If you have to force it, it's probably shit.  

#### Love anybody
I mean, I have friends and I love them but true friends... not very many. Whenever I'm in danger of befriending someone too closely, I usually strayed away in an effort to maintain a safe distance. People most often acted strangely and I felt some awkward expectations. Counter-intuitively, this is probably the easiest one to fix. I have people around me – I just need to trust them more.

## Next
There. Some thoughts. I'm going to start with professional identity first as it's something I don't need a third party to improve. Being happier at work is such a huge deal for me and it would easily radiate into the other topics. I know what I want to do professionally, but I've just had really bad luck regarding actual real world opportunities to do it. Even writing this down further strengthens my resolve.
