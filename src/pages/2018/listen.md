A colleague wanted to know how to be a better listener and asked me for help. I was bit taken aback until I realized that it indeed is a learned skill. Once I got into university I learned it on my own by observing people who I ranked as being socially adept (ie. not the cool guys). It was just another obstacle for me on my journey to understand what's happening on this planet. I still don't know, but at least I can listen. 

I'll tell you my tips and tricks. Note that the things I say are stuff I have came up with through natural observation and their effectiveness largely depend on the culture and social atmosphere you live in, not to mention your willingness to change yourself. 

## Connecting people

We're talking about becoming a better _listener_. Have you ever had something exciting you really want to talk about but you were afraid the subject matter was unimportant, silly or maybe a little embarrassing? A minor thing important to you. Why would it be important to someone else? You drop it and you never come back to it. The courage required to trust someone with your story is significant. You, as the listener, must respect that.

Someone coming to you about their stuff, menial or not, is a sign of trust. They need someone to hear them out and have chosen _you_ specifically to trust this moment with. This is important: __if you are indifferent about the speaker's issue, you will lose the game.__ The speaker will notice a lack of satisfactory feedback to their story and leave disappointed. Think of it as a customer service situation. The bond between you, the listener, and the speaker will shatter and _they will not come back_, or if they do, they do it through gritted teeth – not expecting a result.

Of course, in your heart you know this. It's the very basics of building human relationships which comes naturally to us. When you were still dating your significant other, everything they did or said was the most matter-of-fact in your life. We just tune this behaviour down once we achieve what we want. The trick is to apply a similar interest to every human interaction you come across. Yes, even total strangers who might feel aggressive to you. Being genuinely interested in someone's story is a very effective way to dispel tension. (Use your head, though.)

## The most important person

Now that you have their attention, it's time to listen. The problem is... their story is really boring. Your colleague rants about something in slight frustration. Your friend complains about the latest World of Warcraft expansion. Your brother is still unhappy with his life. 

The thing is, they are still trusting you with their issue. Whether you want these people in your life at all is a story for another time, but for now let's just roll with it. The infamous phrase _fake it till you make it_ applies here as well. Your disinterest is not their problem – it's yours. Their story is not boring to _them!_ The speaker trusts you and you must continue to deserve that trust. The speaker is __the most important person in your life__ in that moment. 

> _What if I get an important phone call? I often have important business to attend to._ 

Is it important? Really? This is probably the biggest detail you must be able to change in yourself. The speaker is truly the most important person in your life at that moment when they come to you with their story. Here are some tips to help tuning in:

- Upon encountering a minor distraction, disregard it and keep focusing on the speaker. Ensure the speaker still is the most important person in that moment. Eye contact and such.
- Upon encountering a major distraction, such as when expecting a _very_ important phone call, immediately take control of the situation and assert that _hey Speaker, you are still the most important person in my life, but I will quickly handle this, so don't go anywhere and we'll continue in just a moment_. After handling the distraction, __you must get back to the speaker!__ Hunt them down if you must, in case they are no longer present and ensure the speaker is satisfied.

## Attack of the listener

Listening alone is not enough. An ear does not satisfy or solve a problem. Now that that the speaker has been established as the most important person in your life, _naturally_ the things they say are _really interesting_. During the speaker's talk, furiously attempt to cherry-pick information nuggets which you can use to immediately ask follow-up questions. Forcing yourself to come up with questions doubles as an excellent mental exercise to help tuning in to their story if the story is meaningless to you. 

Don't be afraid to interrupt with your questions, as strange as it sounds. Genuine questions are an excellent signal for having received their message, and mid-way questions reassure the speaker that they are indeed welcome and should continue. If all goes well, the speaker is happy that not only could they offload their story, you were engaged and probably solved a couple of things along the way.

## Tell me something

I'll leave you with one final trick which is really useful in building friendships and co-worker relations: you can force your friend to become a speaker, making them build trust in you. When someone seems to have a bit of time to spare, say, at work, go to them and ask them to tell you something. Just something. _Tell me a thing!_ _Tell me something!_

What's wrong with the good ol' _whats up_, you ask. Questions like _whats up_ have a cultural foundation in that they are generic throw-away lines and also culturally expect a similar as meaningless answer. There is no genuine interest here.   

Telling someone to tell _something_ has multiple benefits. It comes out of nowhere in that it's an unusual question. It forces engagement. _Uhh, what do you want me to tell you?_ is the usual response. Remember when you had that thing you wanted to talk about but you prematurely decided that the thing was too dumb to talk about? Let's help people overcome this! 

If they ask you for clarification, bait them.
- Well, tell me something that you've been interested in lately – I want to hear about it. 
- How about that _some other thing_ we talked about earlier – how is it going?
- I noticed you carry that weirdly shaped backpack, is it an instrument? Tell me about this thing, then.

__Pay attention to the phrasing!__ You do not want to be cool and establish some kind of social standing about their interests, instead you must ensure it becomes a speaker-listener relationship identical to what we just discussed, where the speaker can speak freely of the things they desire! _Your prior knowledge of the subject matter is meaningless!_ Let them talk to their hearts content and when you see their smile, you have saved the day. Usually the smile comes in about 0.2 seconds. Who wouldn't like to talk about something close to their heart?

That's all I have on this topic. Go forth and save the world – one person at a time.
