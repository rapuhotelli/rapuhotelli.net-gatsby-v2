Being able to achieve _flow_ states is one of the most enjoyable parts of my line of work. I love doing stuff with passion and genuine interest. However, a recent encounter taught me a lesson.

Suddenly it didn't seem like I could get anything done. I was unsatisfied with my work and I was starting to get a bit worked up about it. I take my work quite seriously and me getting frustrated and overly self-judgemental is bad times all-around. I even wrote about [my recent trip](/2018/evaluation), though at the time I didn't know these were related. Now I feel like deleting that post because it's a bit crazy, but I'm leaving it as a reference and a reminder.

I had just started a new project at a new working environment, hoping to solve my challenges with a breath of fresh air when it suddenly struck me. I called a friend and met him later that day to... stock me up. Weekend came and went and the following Monday and Tuesday were the most enthusiastic and productive (or so it felt – never mind what was actually achieved) days in the last two months. How could I have been so stupid?

Of course it was nicotine. I even wrote a [grand declaration](/2018/health) about my ambitions. Taking on the stress of having to prove myself to my peers, my clients and whoever the fuck, _and_ at the same time trying to tackle the effects of physical chemical withdrawal was a moronic idea. My grand plans still stand, mind you – the timing was just the worst possible. To my defense, when I started on my grand quest of dropping nicotine I didn't know how my work would end up being and to that end the levels of self-loathing remained undefined.

It feels silly but you have to be honest with things like this. The problem can be summarized into two choices:

1. Take a hit to productivity and start fighting with anxiety while trying to heal my nicotine addiction
2. Go on like always and keep using nicotine

You can say anything but to me the choice is obvious. I'm in no position to bargain yet. I'm at the top of my world and I will not risk it for mundane issues like health ;) I have never been happier and nicotine addiction is a small price to pay. I will wait for maybe half a year, or however long it takes for me to be satisfied with my daily results, and then try again. I know I will succeed. It's not about succeeding in it or not as I've done it before, I just need a... mentally safe environment to do it.

Meanwhile I can work on my other promises. Summer is coming and next weekend I'm gonna clean and oil my bike and take it for a test ride. Tomorrow a gym is opening literally downstairs from work and thus I'm out of any possible excuses. I'm expecting great things from this summer.
